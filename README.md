Webscraping of jewels site

With this simple chunck of code it is possible to scrape the rings features of the site "www.zales.com". It is possible to scrape all the other objects, necklace etc, (I have also the code for it) but I limited the code only with the rings to avoid IP blocking.
For the same reason I limited the scraping for the first 1000 rings. The result is showed as a ".txt" file in the repository.
